# First Attempt

This directory contains the files that I created for my first attempt creating a GKE cluster with Terraform.

deploy1.tf is the main file, which should work on it's own (after setting the correct GCP project, note there are a few references to it)


Most of this was created by following [Anton Putra -  How to Create GKE Cluster Using TERRAFORM? (Google Kubernetes Engine & Workload Identity)](https://youtu.be/X_IK0GBbBTw)
