# Semester 3 Personal Project

This file contains the files from my University Semester 3 Personal project, which is to work with Kubernetes to understand how it can be used for scaling AI services. 

The project revolves around the below:
- Running AI workloads locally
- Running AI workloads in Kubernees
- Using Terraform (IaC) to deploy enviroments to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- Using Terraform to deploy AI workloads to GKE
- Autoscaling AI workloads in GKE

I will continue adding more to this repository including updating the Readme.
